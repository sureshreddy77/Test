What is Continuous Integration ?
    -Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice  where Merging/Integrating the code from all developers into one central branch of the shared repository
	 frequently, preferably several times a dayto avoid the conflicts in the code and isolated changes are immediately tested and reported
	-It also allows you to automate the build and testing process, so that the new code will automatically tested 
	-CI automatically monitors the code commits from every developer and trigger new build
	
	-Example: Commit a new code to Version Control system(Git). 
	-Jenkins trigger a new build with build tool whenever the new code Committed to Source code repository.
	-Then the code  will be tested in testing environment and send the report back to developers.

    Advantages
	-Frequent Commits hence small feature release
	-Automated build and Testing
	-Instant Feedback to Developers
	-Low risk and faster delivery
         
		 
What is Continuous Delivery ?
    -It build and automates the software release process in a way that the software can be deployed to production at any time.
	-Here deployment to Production environment is Manual(you need approval)
	-A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control
	 right through to your users and customers
	
What is Continuous Deployment ?
    - Every change or commit which goes into the source code repository, that will automatically deployed into the production environment without any approval(without human interaction).

	
1) Planning Phase            - Jira       -Architect
                               Under Settings--> Addons we can integrate Git,So for every commit we will get new task
2) Source Code Management    - Git        -Programmer          
3) Code Review               - Sonarquebe -Code Analyst  
                               We need 3  things
                               Source Server  ----->  we can write rules on SonaQube server  (Under Global tool Configuration)
							   Source Code	----> install Pluig and provide URL, User Name, Passowrd and authentication Token
							   scanner(broker)---> in properties file we need to mention SonarQube Server details      
4) Build Management          - Maven      -Build Engineer
                               Maven validate
                               Maven Compile ----> create a job   (Build --> under maven goals ---> compile)
							   Maven Testing  ----> create a job  (Build --> under maven goals ---> test)
							   Maven Package ---->    create a job (Build --> under maven goals ---> package)
							   Maven Deploy to repository
							   
5) Unit Testing              - Junit      -Programmer
                               POM.xml modification in Maven
							   we can use frameworks
6) Packaging                 - War, Jar   -Infrastructure
                               POM.xml 
							   
7) Artifact Repo Management  - Nexus/JFrog      -Infrastructure
                             - need 2 modifications to upload the package
                             - POM.xml Modification in Maven --------->  <distrubuted management>
							 - we have to tell where is our Artifactory repository URL and Repository name
							 - settings.xml modification in Maven conf ------> <server>
                             - Then goto Maven home type Maven Deploy  
							   
8) Deploy to Qa Environment  - Docker     -OPS Team
9) Testing                   - Selinium   -Testing Team
10)Code Coverage             - Jacoco     -Testing Team
11)Release
