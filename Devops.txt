1)  Explain Devops ?
    - DevOps promotes communication and collaboration between business, development & operations teams. In a way, we are talking about unification.
    - DevOps is not only about tools but also about involving different teams and process.
    - DevOps is inspired by the Agile process. It is about automating the development, release and operation processes.
    - DevOps helps in the speed of delivering applications to the end users.
    - DevOps is also about continuous improvement which helps in learning through feedback.
	- DevOps implementation varies from one organization to other organization,
	  but every organizations are looking to deliver the software faster
	- DevOps implementation is not successful without CI and CD practices.
	- It is very important for the Ops team to ensure that the applications are working very well at appropriate levels.
	  If required they will need to work with the development teams to build any tools 
	  that would help to build the right monitoring capabilities into the applications.


In the waterfall process, as all of us are aware initially complete Requirements are gathered,
next project design, development, testing, deployed to end user.
In this process, the problem was that there was a huge waiting time for build and deployment which made it very difficult to get the feedback.

The solution to the above problem was that the Agile process has to bring in agility in both development and operations.
The focus area is to release the software in a very timely manner with shorter release cycles and quick feedback.
So the agile process focus will mainly be on speed and in DevOps, it works well with the automation of various tools


How will you approach when a project needs to implement devops?
    - Architect should be involved to conduct this assessment.
	- POC has to be done end to end,
	  Once this has been accepted and approved by the end users only then the actual implementation
 
 
2)   Can you explain the uses of the tools just mentioned and how they connect to give a DevOps model (CI/CD)?
    - Planning    Jira – Used for Project Planning and Issue management
    - Continuous Integration
        Git – Version Control
        Jenkins – Open Source Continuous Integration tool which can also help in Continuous Delivery.
        SonarQube – Code analysis
        JFrog Artifactory – Binary Repository Manager
    - Continuous Delivery
        Chef / Puppet / Ansible – Configuration Management and Application Deployment
        IBM Urbancode Deploy / CA RA – Continuous Delivery
    - Continuous Monitoring
        Nagios / Splunk
