	/etc/sysconfig/jenkins , Default port is 8080
What is Jenkins ?
    -It is an automation server, Open source software, written in Java and Pltform Independent
    -Used for (CI/CD) Continuous Integration and  Continuous Delivery/Deployment
    -Jenkins helps to automate the software development process and Deployment process
    -Jenkins is just an orchestrator, which makes the life of the developer easier to keep the tack of successful build 
    and integrate changes continuously and rectify the defects on time
    
Advantages of using Jenkins are:
    -Do not need to check the code and start to build manually.
	-Whenever there are changes in source code, an automatic build will get started.
	-If there are any build failures, automatic email sends to concerned team.
	-Bugs or defects can be easily tracked and resolved at early stages.
	-Helps in achieving the continuous integration agile development and test-driven development.
	-It makes the process faster and smoother.	
	
What is Jenkins pipeline ?
    -It is a combination of plugins that support integration and implementation of Continuous delivery pipelines using Jenkins.
    -in Jenkins, Pipeline is a group of Jobs which are interlinked with one another in a sequence.
	-Jenkins pipeline has the ability to support the automation of software devepolment process.
	-Jenkins basicaly do Build ------->Test---------->Deploy
	
Define the process of Jenkins?
    -In Source code management repository, developers need to commit their code on daily basis 
    -GIT and SVN are widely used nowadays.
    -After committing the changes, Jenkins will detect the changes from the code repository and triggers new build automatocally
     because Jenkins check the repository changes at regular intervals.
    -It will continue through different stages which are mentioned in the Jenkins pipeline.
    -If one job will get successfully completed then it will go to another task or job.
    -If particular job fails, Jenkins build stops there and it will not proceed further.
    -Jenkins has a feature to send the email notification to a concerned team or to particular email id, which has been configured for Jenkins.
    -If all the jobs are successfully completed then it will deploys the code in particular mentioned server(usually testing environment)
    -If the testing gets passed successfully, it will deploy into another environments. 
    -The whole process keeps on iterating whenever code will be committed in SCM.
	
Mention the steps to set up Jenkins Job?
	-Go to Jenkins page, select ‘new job’
	-Enter the name of the job and choose ‘build free-style project’.
	-Click ok and start configuring your job.
	-Put the details of SVN or GIT repository, where the source code has been placed.
	-Provide all other information regarding plugins that required using in a project like for unit testing, code coverage, code quality.
	-Mention the build tool script like Maven script.
	-Collect the information regarding results
	-Configure the steps to send the notifications via emails, etc.

How to schedule a build in Jenkins ?
    -Under job configuration we can define various build triggers. find the "Build Triggers" and check the "Build Periodically" checkbox
    -Minutes(0-59), Hours(0-23), Day(1-31),Month(1-12), Day of the week(0-7)

What is Jenkinsfile ?
    -It is a text file that contains the defination of a Jenkins Pipeline and it is checked into source control. 
	(or)
	-The Jenkins pipeline details are stored in a file that is named as the Jenkins file 
	 and it is further connected to the source code repository in general.
	-It should always be implemented into the source control.
	-It is written in Groovy.
	-Jenkinfile consist of 3 stages. Build, Test and deploy
    
****- Jenkins file can be defined by either web UI or using Jeninks file that you can place in repository 
      it is generally considered best practice to define the Pipeline in a Jenkinsfile and check that in to source control
    - There are two types of syntax used for defining Jenkins file
	  1) Scripted Syntax
	  2) Declarative Syntax
      https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/


*****Nodes
     - Jenkins Home ----> Manage Jenkins ----> Manage Nodes  ---> new node ---> No executors(No jobs parallel jobs at the same time)
     - In Jenkins Job, in general restrict where this project can be run


How to create a backup and copy files in Jenkins ?
    -All you need to do is to periodically  backup your JENKINS_HOME directory.
  

    1 yum install httpd
    2 rpm -qf /etc/httpd
	  sudo systemctl start httpd
	  sudo systemctl status httpd
	  sudo systemctl enable httpd
	  
    3  java -version
    4  yum install java
    5  java -version
    6  yum install jenkins
    7  curl --silent --location http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo
    8  sudo rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key
    9  yum install jenkins
   10  sudo systemctl start jenkins  or  sudo service jenkins start
   11  sudo systemctl status  jenkins
   12  sudo systemctl enable jenkins
    /etc/sysconfig/jenkins in CentOS/RHEL or 
	/etc/default/jenkins in Debian based distributions and change the JENKINS_PORT=  
    	
docker run -p 8090:8080  -v /root/jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home -u root  jenkins
docker run -it -p 8090:8080 jenkins /bin/bash interactive mode


to see default password cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
to check which port in running on jenkins   sudo /usr/sbin/lsof -i -P | grep -i jenkins
to change the default port number vi /etc/sysconfig/jenkins then restart

Jenkins_HOME =/var/lib/jenkins
default clone location is Workspace under Jenkins home
