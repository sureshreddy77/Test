1) Explain what is Maven? How does it work?
   - It is a apache product
   - Maven is a Build tool
   - Maven is a project management tool.
   - It provides the developer a complete build lifecycle framework.
   - On executing Maven commands, it will look for POM ﬁle in Maven; 
   - It will run the command on the resources described in the POM(Project Object Model).
   - POM.xml and src will be inside your Maven home directory
   - Maven Repository has archetypeinfo and dependency info 
   
   Problems without Maven
   Multiple Jars{- spring and hybernates framework}
   Dependencies and versions
   Project structure
   Build, publish and deploy

4) Explain what is POM?
   In Maven, POM (Project Object Model) is the fundamental unit of work. It is an XML ﬁle which holds the
   information about the project and conﬁguration details used to build a project by Maven.

5) Explain what is Maven artifact?
   - Usually an artifact is a JAR ﬁle which gets arrayed to a Maven repository. 
   - One or more artifacts a maven build produces such as compiled JAR and a sources JAR.
   - Each artifact includes a group ID, an artifact ID and a version string.

13) List out what are the build phases in Maven?
    Build phases in Maven are
    - Validate
    - Compile
    - Test
    - Package
    - Deploy

11) Mention the difference between Apache Ant and Maven?
    Apache Ant Maven
    - Ant is a toolbox — Maven is a framework
    - Ant does not have formal conventions like project directory structure — Maven has conventions
    - Ant is procedural; you have to tell to compile, copy and compress — Maven is declarative(information on what to make & how to build)
    - Ant does not have lifecycle; you have to add sequence of tasks manually — Maven has a lifecycle
    - Ant scripts are not reusable — Maven plugins are reusable


2) List out what are the aspects does Maven Manages?
   Maven handles following activities of a developer
  - Build
  - Documentation
  - Reporting
  - Dependencies
  - SCMs
  - Releases
  - Distribution
  - Mailing list

3) Mention the three build lifecycle of Maven?
  - Clean: Cleans up artifacts that are created by prior builds
  - Default (build): Used to create the application
  - Site: For the project generates site documentation

6) Explain what is Maven Repository? What are their types?
   A Maven repository is a location where all the projectjars, library jars, plugins or any other particular
   project related artifacts are stored and can be easily used by Maven. Their types are local, central and remote

7) Why Maven Plugins are used?
   Maven plugins are used to
    - Create a jar ﬁle, 
    - Create war ﬁ|e
    - Compile code ﬁles
    - Unit testing of code
    - Documenting projects
    - Reporting

8) List out the dependency scope in Maven?
   The various dependency scope used in Maven are:
    - Compile: It is the default scope, and it indicates what dependency is available in the classpath of theproject
    - Provided: It indicates that the dependency is provided by JDK or web server or container at runtime
    - Runtime: This tells that the dependency is not needed for compilation but is required duringexecution
    - Test: It says dependency is available only for the test compilation and execution phases
    - System: It indicates you have to provide the system path
    - Import: This indicates that the identiﬁed or speciﬁed POM should be replaced with the dependencies in that POM’s section

9) Mention how proﬁles are speciﬁed in Maven?
   Proﬁles are speciﬁed in Maven by using a subset of the elements existing in the POM itself.

10) Explain how you can exclude dependency?
    By using the exclusion element, dependency can be excluded

12) In Maven what are the two setting ﬁles called and what are their location?
    In Maven, the setting ﬁles are called settings.xml, and the two setting ﬁles are located at
    - Maven installation directory: $M2_Home/conf/settings.xml
    ' User’s home directory: ${ user.home }/ .m2 / settings.xm|


14) List out the build, source and test source directory for POM in Maven?
    - Build = Target
    - Source = src/main/java
    - Test = src/main/test

15) Where do you ﬁnd the class ﬁles when you compile a Maven project?
    You will ﬁnd the class ﬁles ${basedir}/target/classes/.

16) Explain what would the “jar: jar" goal do?
    jar: jar will not recompile sources; it will imply just create a JAR from the target/classes directory
    considering that everything else has been done

17) List out what are the Maven's order of inheritance?
    The maven’s order of inheritance is
    - Parent Pom
    - Project Porn
    - Settings
    - CLI parameters

18) For POM what are the minimum required elements?
    The minimum required elements for POM are project root, modelVersion, groupID, artifactID and version

19) Explain how you can produce execution debug output or error messages?
    To produce execution debug output you could call Maven with X parameter or e parameter

20) Explain how to run test classes in Maven?
    To run test classes in Maven, you need sureﬁre plugin, check and conﬁgure your settings in
    setting.xml anol pom.xml for a property named "test."
