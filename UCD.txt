1)  What is UCD ?  '[install_dir]/conf/server/installed.properties'and update the external URLs in the server. 8080, 8443
    - UrbanCode Deploy is a tool for automating application deployments through your environments
	- It uses distrubuted server agent model
    - server communicate with agents which are installed on target systems, these agents are responsible for automating the deployment process
    - It orchestrates the deployment of application, databases and configurations into development, test and production environment   
	- It has advanced inventory management system that allowing you to know what is deployed in certain envirnment.
    - It has ability to take environmemnt snapshots which are successful test(collection of artifacts and aconfiguration) 
	- It can compares the snapshots with new code and we can deploy only certian necessery changes instead of everything
    - It provides  an option to add approval for every deployment, once the approval is complete then deploment will begin automatically
    - we can preview the deployments and do rollbacks
    - We can do different Configurations between the environments 
    - Clear visibility: What is deployed where and who is changed what
     
	Agent relays 
	- An agent relay is a communication proxy for agents that are located behind a firewall 
    - Agent relays improves the performance of communication across networks between remote agents and the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server. 
	- An agent relay requires only a single system in the remote network to communicate with the server.
	
	- If multiple agents are in a remote network without an agent relay, each agent must connect to the server individually.
	- In this case, each agent must have network permission to connect to the server, including firewall permissions.
	- With an agent relay, the agents connect only to the relay, and the relay is the only system that contacts the server directly,	such as with a VPN or tunnel.
	
3) Key Elements
	
    - Components: The piece of application which is being depoyed( under versions) we will have 
	  - Processes
	  - properties
	  - Versions
	  - Source Connent
    - Applications: collection of components that are deployed togehter
	  - Processes
	  - Components
	  - Environments
	  - Snapshots
	  - Properties
    - Resources: It is the target of deployment, a system where agent is installed
    - Environments: Dev, QA, Staging, Prod
    - Processes: Set of steps and instructions that operate components in a sequence like stop, deploy and start
    - Plugins: provide functions

List of Stepts to setup UDeploy
 
    - Install Server
    - Install agent
    - Enable server and agents as service when the VM is reboot
	       cp -pr agent from /opt/ibm-ucd/agent/init   to /etc/rc.d/init.d/init
	       rename agent to xyz_Name
	       vi agent and change user and group name
	       create soft link ln -s /etc/re.d/init.d/agent  /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/agent  level5 do the same for level 3 and 4
	       chkconfig agent --list
		   service agent status
    - Connecting agent to the server
	       Go to Settings
           system settings
	       Agent for version import then select agent and save
           Resource tab click agents and see agent status
    
Work-Flow
    - Create a base resource
	- Add resource to your agent
	- Create a component
	- Add version to the component
	- Add process to the components
	- Create application
	- Add components to your application
	- Ceate application environment process 
	- Create application environment
	- Add resources to your application
