Questions On Below Topics
1) SitrMInder

What is site minder ?
Siteminder is a basically a user authentication and authorization component from CA. It primarily works with a web based application.
Siteminder can either protect a web server usining web agent or protect a web server using ASA agents and it is the most popular web agent because ASA agents are not simple and require separate licences. 
SiteMinder provides policy-based authentication as well as single sign-on for all Web-based applications. 
SiteMinder is used in conjunction with IdentityMinder, which manages detailed user profiles, and TransactionMinder, which provides access to Web services.
Default: SmHost.conf


2) SSL/TLS Certificates operations

Secure Socket Layer/Trasport Layer Security
Versions TLS 1.1 -- 2006
         TLS 1.2 -- 2008
 		 TLS 1.3 -- 2018

Why do we need SSL Certificates ?
For Source Identity Verification weather the website is trusted or not? and Client/Server authentication to check the request is valid or not. 


How SSL Works?
CA authority issues their public key to Browser verdors like Chrome, Morzilla Firefox
All the CA certificates are stored in the browsers.
Once you enter the URL through your browser/client, the request goes to web-server. 
After that they both athenticate and handshake with the certificate that is  place on the web-server which is issued by CA authorities. 
If the client/server authentication is successful then web-server forward the request to application server and get the responce from application.

What is Jboss CLI ?
Jboss command line utility. 


What are the diffrences between standalone and domain modes ? 
Standalone mode is single JVM process where every JBoss server has its configuration. If you just need one JVM or development environment, then standalone would be perfect.
Domain mode may have multiple servers where all configuration is managed centralized and often used in production environment


What is process controller ?
Process Controller - a JVM Process that has Operational responsibility to carry out start/stop/restart life cycle of Managed Servers Domain 


What is host controller ?
Host Controller - a JVM Process that has responsibility to carry out the configuration Sync between the Managed Server and the Domain controller

What is Host.xml contail ?
JVM configuration file, JVM properties and arguments, heap min and max will be defined in this file, each slave server will have host.xml


What is domain controller ?
It is a master server which maintains the application/cluster cinfuguration

What are the Configuration files in JBoss EAP ?
Domain.xml: centralized configuration file which will be on JBoss primary node or master, it has the profiles, configuration, data source and Messaging and it loads the hash content of the deployed applications
Standlone.xml: standalone file which will be on all of the JBoss nodes, it has the profiles, configuration, data source and Messaging and it loads the hash content of the deployed applications
Host.xml: JVM configuration file, JVM properties and arguments, heap min and max will be defined in this file, each slave server will have host.xml



What is the difference between standalone and domain mode ?
Standalone mode is single JVM process where every JBoss server has its configuration. If you just need one JVM or development environment, then standalone would be perfect.
Domain mode may have multiple servers where all configuration is managed centralized and often used in production environment.


Can you create a cluster in standalone mode ?
Yes, clustering is possible in standalone mode. However, an application must be deployed on each server/JVM in standalone mode


How To Start Jboss In Standalone Mode ?
Answer :Go to bin folder where JBoss is installed and start with the following command.    ./standalone.sh or you can run through  startup script.


What will happen when master instance is down ?
The DC does not affect operations on the cluster. It can be safely restarted without interrupting availability. Obviously, during its downtime, no configuration changes can be made.
Changes to the domain configuration should be made to the CLI instead of modifying directly the XML, if the domain is running.
You only need to restart the resource which is affected by your change: since number of owners is per-cache, you just need to restart that cache.


What will happen when you hit the domain.sh ?
It will start the sever/cluster with the parameters that are mentioned in the sartup script.


What is thread dump ?
It’s a snapshot of all the running processes
Jstack port number


What is heap dump ?
