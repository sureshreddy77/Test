Blue/Green deployment
	In Blue Green Deployment, you have TWO complete environments.
	One is Blue environment which is running and the Green environment to which you want to upgrade.
	Once you swap the environment from blue to green, the traffic is directed to your new green environment.
	You can delete or save your old blue environment for backup until the green environment is stable.
